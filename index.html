        <h3>Experience and Goals</h3>
        <p class="divp">My experience with web design includes creating custom pages using html, CSS, and a little javascript.  I enjoy working with CSS and html, however I do hope to learn more about javascript in this course.  I would also like to learn more advanced features for website design.</p>

        <h3>Future?</h3>
        <p class="otherp">Looking into the future I think I would like to work with a development team to design websites for clients.  I currently work at Hanes Brands Inc. so there could be an opportunity for me to move up and work on our sites within my current workplace.  I enjoy working with html and css, so I know it's something I would enjoy doing as a career.</p>
